Updated till Fev/2021. OpenCore 0.6.6

Using on a Elitebook 830 g5 with touchscreen, with fenvi BCM94360NG wifi card, 512gb NVME ssd, 8350u CPU, 16gb.
IT SHOULD WORK AT LEAST FOR ANY 8X0 G5 elitebook.

ABOUT CAMERA (WEBCAM): IT EITHER WORKS OR NOT! EACH COMPUTER HAS DIFFERENT NON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS.
!! THERE IS NO POSSIBLE FIX FOR IT !!

Final touches: please edit config.plist with your own PLATFORMINFO (each computer should have a unique info here).



UPDATED FOR THE LATEST BIOS ONLY 1.14 (or more recent)


WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Touchpad buttons, middle mouse joystick. Webcam might not work (it works out of the box, or it doesn't!)!! True Hybernation doesn't work (it only sleeps to RAM).
Everything else seems to work properly!
I do not support Native windows wifi card, but there are option that seems to work (AirportItlw).
