READ EVERYTHING.

Compatible with Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey. Might be compatible with older version (not tested).

NO MAJOR BUGS atm.

NOTICE: PM991, PM981 and Micro 2200 are troublesome! Do not use it for hackintosh! PM961 (as mine) is fine, as any other than these two.

CLEAN NVRAM after every OPENCORE UPDATE to avoid errors.

Updated till Jan/2022. OpenCore 0.7.6; MacOS 12.1
Works with dual boot Windows 10 or any other OS.

Using on a Elitebook 830 g5 with touchscreen, with fenvi BCM94360NG wifi card, 512gb NVME ssd, 8350u CPU, 16gb.
IT SHOULD WORK AT LEAST FOR ANY 8X0 G5 elitebook.

ABOUT CAMERA (WEBCAM): IT EITHER WORKS OR NOT! EACH COMPUTER HAS DIFFERENT NON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS.
!! THERE IS NO POSSIBLE FIX FOR IT !!

Final touches: please edit config.plist with your own PLATFORMINFO- you can use GENSMBIOS.
Using SMBIOS macbookpro15,2 now (better).


UPDATED FOR THE LATEST BIOS ONLY 1.14 (or more recent)


WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Touchpad buttons, middle mouse joystick.
Webcam might not work (it works out of the box, or it doesn't!)!!

True Hybernation might work or not... 
Everything else seems to work properly!
I do not support in this github Native Intel wifi card, but there are option that seems to work (AirportItlw).
