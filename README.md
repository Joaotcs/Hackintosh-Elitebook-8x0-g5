READ EVERYTHING.

Compatible with Catalina/Big Sur. Might be compatible with older version (not tested).

NO MAJOR BUGS atm (touchpad works always, if it stops after sleep, just wait 3seconds, and it will start working again).

NOTICE: PM991, PM981 and Micro 2200 are troublesome! Do not use it for hackintosh! PM961 (as mine) is fine, as any other than these two.

CLEAN NVRAM after every OPENCORE UPDATE to avoid errors.

Updated till March/2021. OpenCore 0.6.7; MacOS 11.2.3
Works with dual boot Windows 10 or any other OS.

Using on a Elitebook 830 g5 with touchscreen, with fenvi BCM94360NG wifi card, 512gb NVME ssd, 8350u CPU, 16gb.
IT SHOULD WORK AT LEAST FOR ANY 8X0 G5 elitebook.

ABOUT CAMERA (WEBCAM): IT EITHER WORKS OR NOT! EACH COMPUTER HAS DIFFERENT NON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS.
!! THERE IS NO POSSIBLE FIX FOR IT !!

Final touches: please edit config.plist with your own PLATFORMINFO (each computer should have a unique info here) - Other sections should not be touched (except if you know what you are doing and if you have older BIOS or a G4/6/7.



UPDATED FOR THE LATEST BIOS ONLY 1.14 (or more recent)


WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Touchpad buttons, middle mouse joystick. Webcam might not work (it works out of the box, or it doesn't!)!! True Hybernation doesn't work (it only sleeps to RAM).
Everything else seems to work properly!
I do not support Native windows wifi card, but there are option that seems to work (AirportItlw).
